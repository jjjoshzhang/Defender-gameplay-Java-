# Defender-gameplay
This project is a 2D arcade-style game developed using Processing, where the player controls a defender aircraft tasked with eliminating incoming enemies such as planes, asteroids, and other flying objects. The defender can move using the W, A, S, and D keys and launch missiles with the M key. Each missile initially moves with the defender and detaches upon launch to target enemies. If an enemy collides with the defender, the player loses one life. Enemies that move off the left side of the screen reappear from the right, ensuring continuous gameplay. The game features a background image and displays the player's current score and remaining lives at the top of the screen. The player earns points for every enemy destroyed, and the game concludes with a "Mission Accomplished!" message when the score reaches or exceeds 100 points. If the player's life count reaches zero, the game ends. The purpose of the game is to create an engaging experience that combines movement control, projectile timing, and real-time scoring, while applying object-oriented programming principles in Java.
